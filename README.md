## 🚨 The Problem

**75% of resumes never reach human eyes.**

Modern companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to automatically filter thousands of applications. Even qualified candidates get rejected because their resumes don't match the exact keywords, format, or structure the ATS is looking for.

**The result?** Talented professionals miss opportunities because of automated gatekeepers.

---

## 💡 The Solution

**ATS Nexus** is an AI-powered resume optimizer that performs intelligent gap analysis between job descriptions and resumes. Using GPT-5, it provides:

- 📊 **Match Score** out of 100
- 🔑 **Top 3 Missing Keywords** for ATS optimization
- ✍️ **2 Specific Bullet Point Improvements** to strengthen your resume
- 📝 **Executive Summary** analyzing overall compatibility, your biggest strength, and the key area to focus on

Think of it as having a senior technical recruiter review your application *before* you submit it.

## 🏆 AI Engineer Challenge: Mission Accomplished

This project demonstrates three core competencies for AI Engineers:

### 1️⃣ **LLM Orchestration**
- Built a FastAPI backend that intelligently routes requests to OpenAI's GPT-5
- Structured prompt engineering for consistent, actionable feedback
- Error handling and response parsing for production-ready deployment

### 2️⃣ **Advanced Prompt Engineering**
- **Developer Role (System Prompt):** Configured GPT-5 to act as an "expert technical recruiter"
- **Structured Output:** Engineered prompts to return match scores, keywords, improvements, and executive summary
- **Multi-part Analysis:** Four-section response format for comprehensive feedback
- **Context Window Optimization:** Efficiently combines job descriptions and resumes in a single request

### 3️⃣ **Full-Stack LLM Deployment**
- **Frontend:** Professional Next.js UI with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion
- **Backend:** Python FastAPI with OpenAI SDK integration
- **Deployment:** Hybrid architecture on Vercel (Next.js + Python serverless functions)
- **Production Features:** Environment variable management, CORS configuration, error handling

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ (managed by `uv`)
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- OpenAI API key ([Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge.git
cd The-AI-Engineer-Challenge
```

### 2. Set Up the Backend

```bash
# Install uv package manager
pip install uv

# Install Python dependencies
uv sync

# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

# Start the FastAPI server
uv run uvicorn api.index:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### 3. Set Up the Frontend

```bash
# Install Node dependencies
npm install

# Start the Next.js dev server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### 4. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key
```
